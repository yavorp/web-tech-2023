    <h1>Quick hummus recipe</h1>
    <main>
      <p>
        This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I have read over the years.

        Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled meats and pitta breads.

          Instructions
        </h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely
          </li>
          <li>
            Add all the ingredients into a food processor
          </li>
          <li>
            Process all the ingredients into a paste
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus, process it for a short time
              </li>
              <li>
                If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time  
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            For a different flavor, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.
          </li>
        </ol>

          Storage
        </h3> 
        <p>
          Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.
          Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.
